## 1. Open Source Concepts in Plain English

If you are new to GitHub and Git, here are the core terms you will encounter:

- **Repository ("Repo")**: The project folder on GitHub containing all code, documentation, and history.
- **Issue**: A tracked task, feature idea, documentation request, or bug report.
- **Fork**: Your own personal copy of the PACT repository on your GitHub account where you can freely make changes.
- **Clone**: Downloading a copy of your forked repository from GitHub onto your local computer.
- **Branch**: An isolated workspace in Git where you make specific changes without affecting the main codebase.
- **Commit**: A saved snapshot or checkpoint of your changes with a short descriptive message.
- **Push**: Uploading your saved local commits from your computer up to your GitHub fork.
- **Pull Request (PR)**: A proposal sent to the PACT maintainers asking them to review and merge your changes into the main repository.
- **Maintainer**: The project developers who review contributions, answer questions, and merge pull requests.

---

## 2. Before You Start

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Visit the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/TheVicky1/Pact_OS/issues) tab. Filter issues with the [`good first issue`](https://github.com/TheVicky1/Pact_OS/labels/good%20first%20issue) and `difficulty:beginner` labels (or browse our [**Curated Issues Master Catalog**](GITHUB_BEGINNER_ISSUES.md) and [**Label Taxonomy**](GITHUB_LABELS.md)).
2. **Avoid Duplicate Work**: Check if someone is already commenting on or assigned to an issue before starting.
3. **Claim an Issue**: Leave a short comment on the issue (e.g., *"I'd like to work on this issue. Please assign it to me."*). A maintainer will confirm your assignment.
4. **Ask Questions**: If any requirement is unclear, ask directly inside the issue. It is always better to clarify early than to rewrite code later.

---

## 3. Choose Your First Contribution (Micro-Contributions)

You do not have to write hundreds of lines of complex code or understand the entire architecture. PACT embraces a **micro-contribution model**: tasks are deliberately scoped to **one single file** and **one specific, high-leverage improvement** (typically 5–30 minutes of focused implementation).

Look for these beginner-friendly labels on GitHub:

- 📖 **Documentation** (`type:docs`): Fix typos, clarify setup instructions, or improve code comments.
- 🎨 **UI Polish** (`type:ui`): Refine button styling, add hover elevations, improve responsive padding.
- ♿ **Accessibility** (`type:a11y`): Add missing `aria-label` or `aria-expanded` attributes, improve keyboard focus indicators.
- 🐛 **Bug Fixes** (`type:bug`): Prevent empty input submissions, fix string pluralizations.
- 🧪 **Unit Tests** (`type:test`): Add single boundary or edge-case test cases to existing test suites.
- 🧹 **Developer Experience** (`type:refactor` / `type:tooling`): Add standard script aliases, clean unused imports.

> 💡 Every Good First Issue includes the **exact target file**, **step-by-step guidance**, **acceptance criteria**, and **local test command** so you can succeed on your very first try!

---

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Open the official PACT repository: [https://github.com/TheVicky1/Pact_OS](https://github.com/TheVicky1/Pact_OS).
2. Look at the top-right corner of the page and click the **Fork** button.
3. In the dialog, select your GitHub username and click **Create fork**.
4. GitHub will create a copy under `https://github.com/<your-username>/Pact_OS`.

---

## Step 2: Install Required Software

Before running PACT on your computer, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js (LTS Version 20.x or 22.x)**:
   - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Node.js includes `npm` (Node Package Manager).
2. **Git**:
   - Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
3. **A Code Editor**:
   - We recommend [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Verify Your Installation
Open your terminal (macOS/Linux) or PowerShell / Command Prompt (Windows) and run:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
git --version
```

If version numbers appear for all three, your environment is ready.

---

## Step 3: Clone Your Fork to Your Computer

### Option A: Using the Terminal (Recommended)

1. Open your terminal or PowerShell.
2. Clone your personal fork (replace `<your-username>` with your actual GitHub username):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Pact_OS.git
   cd Pact_OS
   ```
3. Connect your local repository to the original PACT repository (called `upstream`) so you can stay updated with new changes:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/TheVicky1/Pact_OS.git
   ```

### Option B: Using GitHub Desktop
If you prefer a graphical interface:
1. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
2. Click **File → Clone Repository...**
3. Select your fork of `Pact_OS` and choose a local directory on your computer.

---

## Step 4: Install Dependencies

Inside your `Pact_OS` project directory in the terminal, run:

```bash
npm install
```

This command reads `package.json` and downloads all necessary libraries (such as Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide icons) into a local `node_modules` folder.

---

## Step 5: Set Up Environment Variables

PACT uses environment variables to configure URLs and keys. We provide a template file called `.env.example`.

1. Copy `.env.example` to create your private `.env.local` file:

   **macOS / Linux / Git Bash / PowerShell:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

   **Windows Command Prompt:**
   ```cmd
   copy .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. *Note for Beginners*: The template values in `.env.example` allow you to run the application UI, explore all views, and run the test suite locally right away without requiring a live Supabase database account.

> ⚠️ **Important**: `.env.local` is listed in `.gitignore`. **Never commit or share your `.env.local` file**, as it is meant to hold local secrets.

---

## Step 6: Run PACT Locally

Start the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

In your terminal, you will see output similar to:
```
▲ Next.js 16.3.4
- Local: http://localhost:3000
✓ Ready in 1.5s
```

Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view PACT running on your machine!

*(To stop the server at any time, press `Ctrl + C` in your terminal).*

---

## Step 7: Quick Project Orientation

Here is a simplified map of the PACT codebase to help you find where to make changes:

```
Pact_OS/
├── src/
│   ├── app/          # Web pages and routes (e.g., /app/planner, /app/tasks)
│   ├── components/   # Reusable UI elements (buttons, inputs, modal dialogs, cards)
│   ├── features/     # Feature-specific components (dashboard, calendar, habits, focus)
│   ├── lib/          # Business logic engines (accountability, money math, analytics)
│   └── types/        # TypeScript interfaces and data models
├── docs/             # Product and developer documentation
└── tests/            # Automated domain and security test suites
```

---

## Step 8: Create a Topic Branch

Never make changes directly on the `main` branch. Always create a new branch for your task:

```bash
# 1. Switch to main and pull latest changes from upstream
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# 2. Create and switch to your new branch
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

### Good Branch Name Examples:
- `docs/fix-setup-typo`
- `ui/adjust-card-padding`
- `fix/calendar-event-modal`
- `test/add-money-formatter-tests`

---

## Step 9: Make Your Changes

1. Open the project folder in VS Code (`code .`).
2. Make your edits carefully.
3. Keep your changes focused strictly on the issue you are solving. Avoid editing unrelated files or reformatting large sections of code.
4. **UI Design Reminder**: PACT uses a disciplined **Obsidian Black Canvas** (`#050505`), **Warm White** text (`#F5F5F5`), and **Restrained PACT Gold** (`#D4AF37`). Avoid introducing arbitrary neon colors.

---

## Step 10: Test and Validate Your Changes

Before submitting your work, run these validation checks locally. All 85 authoritative domain test suites run completely offline using mock harnesses with zero live database connection or network credential requirements:

1. **Check Code Quality & Formatting**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

### Code Formatting & Prettier

Keeping code cleanly formatted and linted makes your pull request easy to review and prevents CI failures:

> 💡 **Code Formatting & Linting Guidelines Box**
> - **Run ESLint before committing**: Always run `npm run lint` to catch unused variables, missing React hook dependencies, and formatting issues early.
> - **Verify TypeScript types**: Run `npm run typecheck` to ensure all types and imports compile cleanly.
> - **Recommended IDE Extensions (VS Code)**:
>   - **ESLint** (`dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`) — highlights lint rules inline as you type.
>   - **Prettier - Code formatter** (`esbenp.prettier-vscode`) — keeps indentation (2 spaces), quotes, and trailing commas consistent across `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.json`, and `.md` files.
>   - **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense** (`bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss`) — autocompletes and sorts Tailwind utility classes.
> - **Keep diffs minimal**: Format only the files you touched for your issue so your pull request diff stays small and focused.
2. **Check TypeScript Types**:
   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   ```
3. **Run the Automated Test Suite (85 Suites)**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   # (or: node scratch/run-tests.mjs)
   ```
4. **Run a Single Test Suite (Fast Feedback)**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:file -- tests/habit-completion-service.test.ts
   ```
5. **Run the Secret Scanner**:
   ```bash
   node scratch/secret-scan.mjs
   ```
6. **Verify Production Build** (for code changes):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

If any command reports an error, review the error message, resolve the issue in your code, and run the check again. For common fixes, see the [Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

---

## Step 11: Commit Your Changes

Once your changes are tested and all checks pass, save them to Git:

1. View what files you modified:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
2. Stage your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
3. Save your commit with a clear, concise message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "docs: clarify local setup prerequisites"
   ```

### Commit Message Format:
- `feat: add focus timer sound toggle`
- `fix: resolve task priority dropdown alignment`
- `docs: update troubleshooting guide for Windows users`
- `ui: polish active focus card shadow`
- `test: add unit test for grace period calculation`

---

## Step 12: Push to Your Fork

Upload your local commit to your GitHub fork:

```bash
git push -u origin <your-branch-name>
```

*(Replace `<your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created in Step 8).*

---

## Step 13: Open Your Pull Request

1. Go to your fork on GitHub (`https://github.com/<your-username>/Pact_OS`).
2. You will see a yellow banner: **"<your-branch-name> had recent pushes"** with a green **Compare & pull request** button. Click it.
3. Verify that the **base repository** is `TheVicky1/Pact_OS` and the **base branch** is `main`.
4. Fill in the title and description:
   - **Title**: A concise summary (e.g., `docs: clarify local environment setup for Windows`).
   - **Description**:
     - Explain **what** was changed.
     - Explain **why** the change was made.
     - Link the issue: `Fixes #12` or `Closes #34`.
     - Describe how you tested the change.
     - For UI changes, attach a before/after screenshot.
5. Click **Create pull request**.

🎉 **Congratulations! You have just submitted your Pull Request to PACT!**

---

## Step 14: What Happens After You Submit?

1. **Maintainer Review**: A maintainer will review your Pull Request, verify that tests pass, and review your code.
2. **Feedback & Iteration**: 
   - If changes are suggested, **do not worry!** Code review is a normal, collaborative part of software development.
   - Simply make the requested edits in your local branch, save, commit, and push again (`git push`). Your Pull Request on GitHub will update automatically!
3. **Approval & Merge**: Once approved, a maintainer will merge your Pull Request into `main`.
4. **Recognition**: Your contribution will be celebrated and recognized in [CONTRIBUTORS.md](../CONTRIBUTORS.md)!

## Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why to Avoid It | What to Do Instead |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Editing directly on `main`** | Makes it hard to sync with new updates from upstream. | Always create a topic branch (`git checkout -b fix/my-fix`). |
| **Committing `.env.local` or secrets** | Exposes private credentials or API keys. | Verify `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` and run `node scratch/secret-scan.mjs`. |
| **Mixing unrelated edits** | Large, unfocused PRs take longer to review and may conflict. | Keep each PR focused on a single issue or improvement. |
| **Ignoring lint/type errors** | Broken types prevent successful production builds. | Run `npm run lint` and `npx tsc --noEmit` before opening your PR. |
| **Forgetting to link the issue** | Maintainers have to manually search for context. | Add `Closes #<issue-number>` in your PR description. |
